# GUILD ORGANIZATION SYSTEM | Independent Software Contract
## Overview
An interactive system to remotely update and read from a database, specifically designed for client requirements. Administrators may create and manage guilds, while users may request information about guilds and/or guild members.

This bot's main purpose was to be the backbone system that a very large community consisting of thousands of members would rely on.
This required setting up a database that would constantly be updated and read from.

## Features
Members with the authority can create their own groups (clans), admit members to their clan, promote members to different ranks that would have different levels of access to specific bot commands, scout out other clans and challenge them.
Members also have the ability to check group and player profiles created by the bot that displayed different affiliations, ranks, and total points in a custom point algorithm. 

The bot has numerous other capabilities like ticket opening by reaction, manual point manipulation, and so much more.

## Reflection
At the time of it's creation, this was the largest project I had ever taken.
This is my highest quality discord bot so far (embeds after embeds ðŸ˜­).
This project introduced me into learning databases. I started experimenting with SQLite. 
I was very determined to finish this project, and it was all completed within 1 week.

- Learned SQLite database engine to store guild and user data using queries.
- Used Python and Lua to interact with APIs that bridge several technologies together.
  - SQLite3, Discord, LuaU.
- Created features that were user-appealing according to requirements.
  - Public guild and user profiles that format stored data in visually appealing user interfaces.
  - Global point system with embedded algorithms for guilds and guild members.
