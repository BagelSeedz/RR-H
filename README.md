# RR-H (Commission Bot)

- This bot's main purpose was to be the backbone system that a very large community consisting of thousands of members would rely on.
This required setting up a database that would constantly be updated and read from.
Members with the authority could create their own groups (clans), admit members to their clan, promote members to different ranks that would have different levels of access to specific bot commands, even scout out other clans and challenge them.
Members also had the ability to check group and player profiles created by the bot that displayed different affiliations, ranks, and total points in a custom point algorithm. The bot had numerous other capabilities like ticket opening by reaction, manual point manipulation, and so much more.

- At the time of it's creation, this was the largest project I had ever taken.
- This is my highest quality bot so far (embeds after embeds ðŸ˜­).
- This project introduced me into learning databases. I started experimenting with SQLite. 
- I was very determined to finish this project, and it was all completed within 1 week.
